Creative acts propel me through each day. I am an Oregonian looking to integrate these creative skills into the realm of change. During my days at university, I inhabited creative studios, classrooms and offices.  A degree was earned and after many epiphanies, conversations and inspiration from incredible people, I now inhabit new spaces. I find myself in gardens, in kitchens and in communities.

It’s short and long, long long short and long. My hair is a very very long hair. My care, it’s a very very strong care. I sing this song, I love I love to sing along.
